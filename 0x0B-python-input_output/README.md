7. All about py-file I/O

## General Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* How to open a file
* How to write text in a file
* How to read the full content of a file
* How to read a file line by line
* How to move the cursor in a file
* How to make sure a file is closed after using it
* What is and how to use the with statement
* What is JSON
* What is serialization
* What is deserialization
* How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
* How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure


## Requirements

### Python Scripts
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
5. A _README.md_ file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
6. Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
7. All your files must be executable
8. The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files should end with a new line
3. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
4. All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
5. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
6. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
7. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
8. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
9. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
10. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
