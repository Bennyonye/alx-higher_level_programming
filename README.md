# PYTHON

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

Python was created by Guidovan Rossum in 1989.Multiple implementations of Python exist today,with CPython(written in the C programming language)being the reference implementation.
